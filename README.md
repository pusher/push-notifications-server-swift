## Building the project

`swift build`

## Running the tests

`swift test`

## Installation

To include PushNotifications in your package, add the following to your Package.swift file.

```swift
// swift-tools-version:4.0
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YourProjectName",
    dependencies: [
        ...
        .package(url: "git@github.com:pusher/push-notifications-server-swift.git", from: "1.0.3",
    ],
    targets: [
      .target(name: "YourProjectName", dependencies: ["PushNotifications", ... ])
    ]
)
```

Use `import PushNotifications` to access the APIs.

## Usage

### Migrating from 1.x to 2.x

The 2.0 release contains several improvements, however there are a few breaking API changes if you are upgrading from a 1.x release:

<details>
  <summary>1.x to 2.x migration steps</summary>

1. The SDK replaces its own `Result` implementation the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/result">`Result`</a> type included in Swift 5.0. The API changes subtly when inspecting the result value (e.g. when using a `switch` statement):
    - `.value(let anObject):` becomes `.success(let anObject):`
    - `.error(let anObject):` becomes `.failure(let anObject):`
1. Errors returned by the SDK in a `Result` are now specifically instances of `PushNotificationsError` rather than just `Error`.
1. `PushNotificationsError` has some changes:
    - New error cases have been added covering the error conditions that were previously reported using the `.error(String)` (which has been removed). Testing against SDK errors in your own server app is now straightforward and more robust as no `String` equality checks are required.
    - It now conforms to `LocalizedError`. A human-readable description of an error can be accessed using the `localizedDescription` property on the error.
1. The `publish(_:_:completion:)` method has been removed (this was deprecated in a previous release). The `publishToInterests(_:_:completion:)` method can be used instead.

### Code examples

```swift
// Pusher Beams Instance Id.
let instanceId = "c7c52433-8c65-43e6-9ef2-922d9ed9e196"
// Pusher Beams Secret Key.
let secretKey = "39817C9BCBF7F053CB151343D54EE75"

// PushNotifications instance.
let pushNotifications = PushNotifications(instanceId: instanceId, secretKey: secretKey)

// Interests array.
let interests = ["pizza", "donuts"]
// Publish request: APNs, FCM.
let publishRequest = [
  "apns": [
    "aps": [
      "alert": "Hello"
    ]
  ],
  "fcm": [
    "notification": [
      "title": "Hello",
      "body":  "Hello, world",
    ]
  ]
]

// Publish To Interests
pushNotifications.publishToInterests(interests, publishRequest, completion: { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let publishId):
        print("\(publishId)")
    case .failure(let error):
        print("\(error)")
    }
})

// Publish To Users
pushNotifications.publishToUsers(["jonathan", "jordan", "luÃ­s", "luka", "mina"], publishRequest, completion: { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let publishId):
        print("\(publishId)")
    case .failure(let error):
        print("\(error)")
    }
})

// Authenticate User
pushNotifications.generateToken("Elmo", completion: { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let jwtToken):
        // 'jwtToken' is a Dictionary<String, String>
        // Example: ["token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJhYWEiLCJleHAiOjE"]
        print("\(jwtToken)")
    case .failure(let error):
        print("\(error)")
    }
})

// Delete User
pushNotifications.deleteUser("Elmo", completion: { result in
    switch result {
    case .success:
        print("User deleted ðŸ‘Œ")
    case .failure(let error):
        print("\(error)")
    }
})
```
